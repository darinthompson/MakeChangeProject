## Make Change Project - Week 1 Skill Distillery

### Overview
The app is a simple change making app that returns change to the user in the least amount of denominations necessary. As per the assignment the largest bill is $10USD but could easily be adopted to add different currencies and or larger denominations. I've set it up in a simple while loop that runs until the user enters 0 for item price. 

### Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub/Git
- VIM


### Lessons Learned
- I had issues with the weird math that happens with double values.
- I learned that there are several different ways to get around those issues.
- Searching Google for help I learned about several different algorithms that 
    solve many problems akin to making change.
- I learned the scanner object needs to be cleared if given bad input(i.e. expects and int but given string). It's not possible to just re-ask user for input. So I added a function for validating input that can also easily be changed and used in other programs in the future.
